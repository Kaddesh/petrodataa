## üîß Problem-Solving Approach

### 1. Data Management
**Challenge**: Handling complex petroleum price data across multiple states and fuel types.

**Solution**: 
- Created a centralized data model with TypeScript interfaces
- Implemented utility functions for data filtering and aggregation
- Used React state management for real-time updates

```typescript
interface PetroleumData {
  State: string;
  Period: string;
  AGO: number;
  PMS: number;
  DPK: number;
  LPG: number;
  Region: string;
}
```

### 2. Responsive Design

- Used responsive breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`)
- Created collapsible sidebar for mobile navigation
- Optimized table layouts with horizontal scrolling

### 3. Performance Optimization
**Challenge**: Rendering large datasets without performance degradation.

**Solution**:
- Implemented efficient filtering and search algorithms
- Used React.memo for component optimization
- Lazy loading for chart components
- Optimized re-renders with proper state management

### 4. User Experience
**Challenge**: Making complex data accessible and intuitive.

**Solution**:
- Designed intuitive navigation with clear visual hierarchy
- Implemented real-time search and filtering
- Added interactive charts with hover states
- Created consistent loading and error states

### 5. Code Quality & Maintainability
